# Ethereum-Wallet
Building an Ethereum wallet in C# language
This exercise is part of my studies here at Kingsland University. This is MI2: Module5.
I used a few different packages including Nethereum.HdWallet , Nethereum.Web3 , Newtonsoft.Json ,
NBitcoin , & Rijndael256. For this exercise (and the Bitcoin Wallet in C# exercise) it is reccommended 
to use Visual Studio 2022. Thank you for viewing my Repo!
